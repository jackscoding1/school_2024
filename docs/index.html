    <title>Rotary Encoder Project</title>

</head>
<body>
<p>At the age of fifteen, I built a rotary encoder using cardboard. This project was a valuable learning experience, as it introduced me to several important concepts. The first thing I learned was the fundamental workings of a rotary encoder—how it functions, its practical applications, and its relevance in real-world technology.</p>
<p>I started this project in order to understand how rotary encoders operate, with the goal of eventually creating a more advanced version for a steering wheel simulator. For the initial prototype, I used an infrared break beam sensor, cardboard, tape, hot glue, and an Arduino to store and process the code.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges was the use of cardboard, which lacked the structural integrity needed for precision. However, the most difficult aspect was the coding. I had to learn Python and develop code to track the number of times the cardboard passed through the sensors. The real complexity lay in ensuring that the counter stopped when the wheel stopped, and that it correctly tracked reverse spins, and continued to count upwards.</p>
<p>Another significant area of learning was the electrical side of the project. I familiarized myself with the Arduino, learning how to integrate it with the sensors. This required an understanding of basic electrical concepts such as grounding, current, voltage, resistance, and power, as well as practical skills like using a breadboard to connect components. This hands-on experience provided me with a deeper understanding of electricity and circuitry, including Ohm’s Law and different types of electrical flow.</p>
<p>In summary, building a rotary encoder from cardboard at the age of fifteen was a challenging yet rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of both mechanical and electrical systems. Through this project, I gained knowledge of rotary encoders, from their basic operation to their practical applications, and honed my skills in coding, specifically in Python, to manage complex functions like directional tracking. Additionally, I developed a strong foundation in electrical principles, learning how to work with an Arduino, sensors, and circuit components. This project not only expanded my technical abilities but also fueled my passion for hands-on problem-solving and innovation.</p>
